# speechify-ai-demos

Worked examples that pair with the technical posts on [speechify.ai/blog](https://speechify.ai/blog). Each folder is **self-contained**: copy the folder, follow its README, run it. No root-level tooling, no workspace, no monorepo dance. Pick what you need.

## Demos

| Folder | Stack | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`captions-speech-marks/`](./captions-speech-marks) | TypeScript (native) | Synthesizes audio + builds a WebVTT caption file from the speech marks the API returns in the same response. Karaoke-highlight HTML demo included. |
| [`voice-cloning-narration/`](./voice-cloning-narration) | TypeScript (native) | Clones a voice from a 10-30 sec WAV sample, synthesizes with the new voice, deletes the clone. End-to-end lifecycle. |
| [`audiobook-pipeline/`](./audiobook-pipeline) | Python (SDK) | Chunks long-form text on sentence boundaries, synthesizes each chunk via the Speechify Python SDK, concatenates the MP3s with ffmpeg. |

## What "no tooling" means

There is no root `package.json`, no `pyproject.toml`, no `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, no Turborepo / Nx / Lerna, no shared CI. Each demo brings its own deps and runs on its own. That's the point. You should be able to drop any folder into your own codebase without inheriting anything else from this repo.

## Get an API key

Every demo needs `SPEECHIFY_API_KEY`. Grab one at [console.speechify.ai/api-keys](https://console.speechify.ai/api-keys). Copy `.env.example` to `.env` inside the folder you want to run and paste the key in.
